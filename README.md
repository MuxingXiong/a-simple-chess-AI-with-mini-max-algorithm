This is a project completed in 2022. The project requirements can be found at Project-Reversed-Reversi-EN.pdf, and the project report file is named 12011818_熊牧星.pdf Below is a brief introduction to the project.

In recent years, with the popularity of AlphaGo, the chess AI that beats the world champion in GO chess, people are paying more and more attention to chess AI and the whole field of artificial intelligence.

The AlphaGo we mentioned is a zero-sum chess game. For a zero-sum chess game, the result is either win or lose, so in a fully observable and known environment (like GO game or Reversi game), we can easily make a intelligent agent for us to make better decisions in the zero-sum game and win the game. With proper transformation, the intelligent agent may help us in more zero-sum conditions.

In this project, we intend to make a chess AI that can automatically play Reversed-Reversi. We intend to make this chess AI reliable and powerful that it can beat more human and algorithms and winning the game.
